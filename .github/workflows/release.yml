# Publishes the package to PyPI when a version tag (e.g. v1.2.3) is pushed.
#
# Uses PyPI Trusted Publishing (OIDC) - no API tokens or secrets needed.
# Setup instructions:
#   1. Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/
#   2. Add a new "pending publisher" with:
#        PyPI project name : gmdbuilder
#        Owner             : LXtreme
#        Repository        : gmdbuilder
#        Workflow filename : release.yml
#        Environment name  : pypi
#   3. That's it! Push a tag to trigger this workflow.
#
# To publish a release, run:
#   git tag v1.2.3
#   git push origin v1.2.3
