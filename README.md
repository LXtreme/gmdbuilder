# gmdbuilder
A type-safe general-purpose Python framework for pragmatic Geometry Dash level editing and scripting.

gmdbuilder lets you:
- Read & write Geometry Dash levels
- Work directly with triggers, groups, and objects - and choose your own type-safe abstractions
- Use templates to accelerate development
- Choose your own level of type safety

See practical **Examples**!

gmdbuilder is developed in collaboration with HDanke, the creator of **gmdkit** (a dependency of this framework) and his unofficial **GD Editor Docs**.

*(No overengineered language was made in the making of this project)* 

## Why Python?

Python fits surprisingly well as a language for GD:
- Exceptionally good at building/verifying dictionaries (which all GD objects are)
- Any programming paradigm that you want is well supported
- Reliable type system with good debugger/type-checker tooling
- Huge package ecosystem
